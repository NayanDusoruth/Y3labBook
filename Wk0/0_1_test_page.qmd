# 0.0 Test page

This page is intended to test oneNote features (I.E, equations, diagrams, tables), and generally decide on "how to lab book" - This page is considered not a part of this lab book and will be removed before submission.


Formatting and structure:

* Each week will have its own section made up of pages indexed </WkNum/>.</pageNum/> (I.E, week 1 page 3 == 1.3)
	* Setup a page in Wk0 for references – tabulate entries
* Eqs, tables, figs... will be indexed by week </WkNum/>.</itemCount/> (I.E, third Eq of week 2 == Eq. 2.3)

Table test:


|     Col 1    |     Col 2    |     Col 3    | $C<0$                               |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
|     11       |     12       |     13       | $Ae^{-i\sqrt{C}x}+ Be^{i\sqrt{C}x}$ |
|     21       |     22       |     23       | $De^{-ct}$                          |
|     blah     |              |              |                                     |
|              |     bleh     |              |                                     |
|              |              |     awawa    |                                     |
|              |              |              |                                     |



Equation test: 

$\int f(x)dx=F(x)+c$


Drawing on samsung notes on tablet, selecting image and copy pasting:

![testImage](figures/0_0_test.png "Title=testImage"){fig-align="left"}

Produces a single image file that can be moved around as one piece. This may be the more practical way to do figures and diagrams. Have setup a samsung notes file for lab book diagrams
