Have further read into some of the critical exponents theory as well in order to develop an understanding of how to compute them from our model.\nThe critical exponent theory follows heavily from cite{CritExpLink3} which seems to handle scaling phenomena.\nAs it stands, there may be two approaches to computing the critical exponents:\n\n* Simple case; vary models over temperature and fit some variation of $(T-T_{c})^{x}$ where x is a critical parameter to various observables (as seen in cite{ComplexityAndCriticality} P132-134)\n* Attempt to follow the procedure done by cite{CritExpLink3}\n\nThe former option is simpler and is a natural extension of current work w/dataset object; however am unsure if it'd accomodate finite scaling effects.\nIt may be worth implementing the former case first in order to test the idea; furthermore graphing observables over temperature may give a better idea of the dynamics being explored; so even if this simpler method fails, it may yield experience and insight into the system's behaviour.\n\nNote reading around topic briefly the \"Swendsen-Wang\" and \"Wolff\" algorithms are mentioned; they seem to be used to improve compute times near critical temperatures. Am unsure if they'd be necessary; but noting their existence/potential use case here in case they'd be useful later.\n\nA pure computational approach to extracting critical exponents may thus follow:\n\n* create datasets of dimension d, size L over temperature ranges - try and implement a \"critical temp finding\" method which performs a binary search for the critical temperature in a data range for a given observable\n* fit the simple critical exponent function to the data\n* perform above for a range of sizes for same dimension; compare results\n* if scaling seems predictable; computational approach may be sufficient, and exploration of higher dimension may begin\n* else will need to read up more on how to avoid scaling effects\n\n\nTherefore to do list follows:\n\n* dataset object: finish off; it should be able to return a pandas dataframe of observables over temperature\n* may be useful to generalise dataset object so it may vary model size instead of temperature\n* introduce plotting methods for observables\n* introduce \"critical temperature finding\" methods - comparing derivatives of observables at extremal ends of data, should be able to determine if current location is above/below critical temperature - this would allow a binary search for the critical temperature to arbitrary precision\n* fitting methods of observables to critical temp expressions\n\n* further cleanup of code\n\n\n\n## 02/02/2026:\ntidied up dataset object - introduced a to dataframe method; and cleaned up file saving system.\n\n### dataset object testing\nStarting to generate experimental datasets to gain experience generating large datasets (naming format; </string/></sizeAndShape/>_</numEqSteps/>_</numSimSteps/>:\n\n* testData20x20_1000_100: small 20x20 dataset run over 1000 eq steps, and simulated for 100 steps; range of 20 beta $\\in [0, 3]$ - magnetisation doesn't plot neatly\n* testData50x50_1000_100: small 50x50 dataset run over 1000 eq steps, and simulated for 100 steps; range of 20 beta $\\in [0, 3]$ - magnetisation doesn't plot neatly\n\nneither test case thus far plots neatly as seen:\n\n![Fig 2.1 - Magnetisation plotted over $\\beta$ for testData50x50_1000_100](figures/earlyMagPlot.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Fig 2.2 - Absolute Magnetisation plotted over $\\beta$ for testData50x50_1000_100](figures/earlyAbsMagPlot.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nWhich shows a general increase in absolute magnetisation over $\\beta$ (contrary to what intuition would suggest, with magnetisation increasing for low beta); with the occaisonal datapoint dropped to 0. Furthermore it is odd how absolute magnetisation increases, then suddenly drops as in fig 2.2\n\nThe final configuration states for this data was generated for visual inspection; some examples include:\n\n![Fig 2.3 - Config 0](figures/magTestConfig0){fig-align=\"left\"}\n![Fig 2.4 - Config 15](figures/magTestConfig15){fig-align=\"left\"}\n![Fig 2.5 - Config 16](figures/magTestConfig16){fig-align=\"left\"}\n![Fig 2.6 - Config 19](figures/magTestConfig19){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n\nOn initial inspection the low and high $\\beta$ configs appear reasonable; fig.2.3 shows an orderly config for low $\\beta$ whilst fig 2.6 shows a relatively disorded config. However the intermediate examples show a confusing switch in behaviour from relatively disorganised to organised (these correspond to one of the drops in fig 2.2).\n\nA few things become apparent comparing figs 2.3-2.6 to fig 2.1:\n\n* magnetisation computation is going wrong somehwhere; as highly ordered states (I.E fig 2.3) are reading low magnetisation whilst disorded stats (I.E fig 2.5) are reading high magnetisation. This contradicts an understanding of the underlying theory that ordered ising models should be more magnetised\n* the source of the discontinuous drops are unclear - there is a major drop at $\\beta\\approx 2.4$ alongside several smaller drops; if those smaller drops didn't exist, that large drop could be attributed to a phase transition\n\nThe random drops may be due to noise effects (the magnetistion is averaged over the relatively few 100 simulation steps); however the fact that the magnetisation grows over beta isn't clear.\n\nPerforming larger test:\n\n* testData50x50_1000_1000: note over range $\\beta \\in [0, 4]$\n\nam hoping this will fix some of the data variability and give a clearer picture of phase transitions (even if the magnetisation over $\\beta$ relation is flipped)\n\nam an absolute idiot; $\\beta \\propto \\frac{1}{T}$; so lower $\\beta$ cooresponds to higher $T$; so the pattern seen is as expected - nothing is broken...\n\n\n### additional code development ideas\nMay need to modify dataset object to allow different configs to have different equilibration times; cite{CritExpLink3} suggests that equilibration time may vary over parameters\n\nFurthermore may need to implement system to estimate equilibration times:\n\n* dual system introduced by cite{CritExpLink3} - create 2 configs; one starting all spin up, one all spin down; compare magnetisations of two results until they are within error of each other\n* may be worth implementing as purpose built system - i suspect that the config code can be streamlined purely for the purpose of computing these equilibration times\n* may also be worth creating a \"equilibrationTime dataset\" - able to generate a set of dualConfigs identical to dataset parameters; and spit out equilibration times - maybe make it suck that it can linearly interpolate between equilibrationTime datapoints; would allow for sparser data\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"2_1_labLog.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
