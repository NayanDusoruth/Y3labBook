It appears to have a near discontinuous increase about $T\\approx2$, but has a smoother continuous change as T increases.\nA few potential explanations worth considering:\n\n* From cite{complexityAndCriticality}, it seems that the $|T - T_{c}|^{x}$ expressions are usually one sided; this may be a manifestation of that?\n* May be finite size effect\n\n\nhemlholtz plot finally produced (code errors required re-simulating data for useful results):\n\n![Fig 3.7 - Helmholtz free energies ($d=2$, $L=20$)](figures/helmholtz.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nIt seems that the critical temperature coincides w/minima of helmholtz free energy (ignoring outlying data points). Unsure if this is coincidental or not, however if so, may provide an incredibly easy method of finding the critical temperature.\n\n\n#### dataset data analysis:\nStarting to think about how to analyse the data being generated.\nParticularly, need to do following:\n\n* find the critical temperature\n* fit exponent curves of form $|T - T_{c}|^{x}$ to observables as appropriate (they may be one sided)\n\nTo do so however it is necessary to filter for evident outliers in the data. This may be done manually, however it'd be more convenient to do so automatically.\nA potential means to do this would be to filter by a generic \"continuity check\". Given a particular observable $a_{i}$ with neighbours $a_{i-1}$, $a_{i+1}$; it would interpolate between the neighbours; if $a_{i}$ is within uncertainty of the interpolated value, it is accepted, else it is rejected. This approach may cause erroneous results however when evaluating the edges of the dataset. Since this method relies on neighbours, it can't validate data at either end of the dataset. It may be possible to extrapolate to the data edges from the next 2 nearest points?\n\nThat may be a better way of doing it; extrapolate from the 2 nearest points for the continuity check. For most datapoints that will be both neighbours, however for the endpoints it will extrapolate from the data.\n\nThis method may be a bit crude, but should discard most outliers. \nTHe main risk is that it may \"flatten\" and trends in the data due to datapoints being too far apart from each other. However adequate sampling density should avoid this issue.\n\nQuickly implementing this method on the helmholtz energies yields:\n![Fig 3.8 - Filtered Helmholtz free energies ($d=2$, $L=20$)](figures/helmholtzFiltered.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n\nWhich seems to not work. minor fixes; code is UGLY, but it seems to work.\nFiltering seems to work.\n\nTalked to Dr Turci, asked about the apparent minima in helmholtz free energy; pointed out its a non standard way of finding critical temps; suscpetibility/spin and specific capacity/spin are more common:\n\n$\\chi = \\beta\\frac{<M>^2 - <M^{2}>}{N}$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  Eq. 3.2\n\n$C = \\beta^{2} \\cdot k_{b} \\cdot \\frac{<E>^2 - <E^{2}>}{N}$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  Eq. 3.3\n\n\nattempted implementation; doesn't seem to be working yet.\nneeding to resimulate the data.\nAm also unsure how to propagate errors through the susceptibility and heat capacity either.\npropagating errors in terms yields:\n\n$\\Delta \\chi^{2} = (\\frac{\\beta}{N})^{2}((2<M>)^{2}\\Delta<M>^2 + \\Delta<M^{2}>^2)$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  Eq. 3.4\n\n$\\Delta C^{2} = (\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{N})^{2}((2<E>)^{2}\\Delta<E>^2 + \\Delta<E^{2}>^2)$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  Eq. 3.5\n\n\nsusceptibility seems to be working-ish (errors are massive but given expression i'm not sure error propagation makes sense as a concept) - also peak of susceptibility seems to be offset relative to apparent critical temperature in all other graphs ($T_Cs \\approx 3$).\n\nError found.\nEqs 3.2-3.5 use the mean, code was using weighted average instead.\nQuick graphs produced:\n\n![Fig 3.8 - Susceptibility ($d=2$, $L=20$)](figures/susceptibility.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Fig 3.7 - Heat capacity ($d=2$, $L=20$)](figures/heatCapacity.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nDon't think these work fully. actually unsure if i should used weighted average; textbook seems to indicate weighted average?\nAll of these tests have been conducted on a single dataset (saved for convenience) - it may be worth testing on a larger, more fine grain dataset.\n\n#### To Do list:\n* fix susceptibility and heat capacity computations\n* run big dataset; see if that fixes\n* figure out exponent fitting\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"3_1_labLog.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
