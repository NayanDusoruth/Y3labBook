This works quite well atm though.\n\nnote; curtailing the cumulant fit slightly (curtailing the lower end of the data) seems to improve the fit and improves the critical temperatures\n\nFiddling around with parameters; curtailing data helps magnetisation and heat capacity fit, but not susceptibility which is odd.\n\nGoing to implement power law critical temp method as this also produces estimate for critical exponents\n\n\na factor of 2 is showing up a lot comparing expected vs actual values... this is suspicious \n\n\nimplementing power law method seems to imply $T_{c}=2.45$ which is wrong; matches closely to apparent critical temperature.\n\n\n### power law method:\nPower law method acknolwedges finite size effect with:\n\n$(\\beta(\\infty) - \\beta(V))^{-v}\\propto L$ / / / / / / / / / / / Eq 4.1 \n\nWhich yields:\n\n$\\beta(v) = \\beta_{c}-c_{1}L^{\\frac{-1}{v}}$ / / / / / / / / / / / Eq 4.2\n\nWhich can be fit to the apparent critical temperatures derived from max susceptibility.\n\nSusceptibility thus relates to size as:\n\n$\\chi_{max} \\propto L^{\\frac{\\gamma}{v}}$ / / / / / / / / / / / Eq 4.3\n\nwhich can be fitted, and $\\gamma$ extracted.\n\n### log continued\n\nImplementing the above, and excluding the 50x50 dataset (it seems to be off, will examine for outliers), $v= 0.91$ can be found (inc the 50x50 dataset yields $v=0.45$). These two cases yield $\\gamma=0.44$ and $\\gamma =0.22$. The fact that the 50x50 dataset seems off is frustrating...\n\n\nRefactor code to be a bit cleaner; unsure if the above power law method works fully; given it's critical temp disagrees more significantly with standard values than the cumulant method, i'm hesitant to trust it.\n\n\n### summary of issues at present\nCurrently unsure where to go from here...\nThere is some data issue with the 50x50 dataset, in order to evaluate finite size effects more data over a range of sizes is needed; however that is currently being generated. As such, i'm unsure how to examine my present data.\n\nThe current deviations from standard values generally are:\n* $\\beta \\approx 0.07$ is less than standard value $\\beta = 0.125$\n* $\\gamma \\approx 0.45$ is significantly less than standard value $\\gamma = 1.75$\n* $\\alpha \\approx 0.27$ is significantly greater than stadard value of $\\alpha = 0$\n\n\nThe critical temperature values from the cumulant ($T_{c}=2.229$) vs power law method ($T_{c}=2.451$) disagree significantly, with the cumulant method closer to the standard value of $T_{c}=2.269$. However the power law method is significantly limited by the small amount of data available to it, so this may improve in future.\n\nPresently the power law method provides a reasonable estimate of $v=0.9$ (standard value of 1) if the 50x50 dataset is excluded.\nHowever the power law method does not provide a good estimate of $\\gamma=0.44$ if the 50x50 dataset is excluded. This is however somewhat consistent with the direct fit methods, which implies that whatever issue is causing these effects are present in both datasets.\n\nThat alongside the fact that the direct fit method seems to fit relatively well (given R^2 values are generally $R^{2}_{\\beta}\\approx 0.96$, $R^{2}_{\\gamma}\\approx 0.69$, $R^{2}_{\\alpha}\\approx 0.50$) suggests that this isn't an issue with the analysis, but an issue with the data.\n\nSome possibilities may explain this:\n* incorrect dynamics - some aspect of the simulation is incorrectly implemented\n* incorrect observable computation - the observables (I.E, susceptibility) aren't correctly computed\n* some additional finite size effect hasn't been accounted for\n\n\n\nDr Turci advice:\n* potential optimisation; hardcode 2d, 3d mc sweep\n* power fit as log instead of as is\n* correlated data may be main issue; run data for longer esp near criticality (may be worth computing autocorrelation)\n\t* sample \"sparse\" for susceptibility \n\n\n### Plan of action given this insight:\n* switch exponent fit to log fit - this may address some of my exponent issues\n* try sampling susceptibility on sparser data; see if that improves \"noisiness\" in data\n\t* potentially compute autocorrelation length on data to quantify results\n* extend data over longer MC sweeps\n\t* this may require purpose built optimisation\n\n\n### log continued:\nattempted exponent fit w/log fit; improves results slightly for magnetisation\n\nQuickly attempted to sample every 20th data point for susceptibility to try and reduce correlations; this yields:\n\n![Fig 5.1 - Susceptibility no skips on 50x50 dataset](figures/susceptNoSkips.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Fig 5.2 - Susceptibility w/20 skips on 50x50 dataset](figures/susceptSkips.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nMakes data noisier, worsening issue.\n\nHave implemented \"add data\" method to dataset. Will hopefully allow me to append data and improve results.\n\nTesting on the 20x20 dataset, adding 200 simulation steps results follow:\n\n![Fig 5.3 - magnetisation before additional steps (20x20 dataset)](figures/magBeforeSim.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Fig 5.4 - Susceptibility before additional steps (20x20 dataset)](figures/susBeforeSim.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Fig 5.5 - magnetisation after additional steps (20x20 dataset)](figures/magAfterSim.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Fig 5.6 - Susceptibility after additional steps (20x20 dataset)](figures/susAfterSim.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nQualitatively this seems to improve the noise particularly in the susceptibility. Furthermore the magnetisation exponent $\\beta$ has seemingly improved slightly from $\\beta=0.066$ to $\\beta=0.079$.\nI suspect that this will be the main source of error for most of the exponent data; more data required.\n\nHave also implemented purpose built 2D, 3D and 4D mcMove method to main config; should be faster for those cases; seems faster thus far for 2D case.\n\n\n### Plan from this point:\n* extend main datasets over longer sweeps; see what the effect of this is \n* if this fixes the current issues (particularly noisy susceptibility); then can take main results \n* else may need to look at autocorrelation times\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"5_1_labLog.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
