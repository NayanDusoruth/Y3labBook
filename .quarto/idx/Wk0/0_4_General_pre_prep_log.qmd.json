{"title":"0.4 General pre-prep log","markdown":{"headingText":"0.4 General pre-prep log","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n15/01/2026\n\nAdded recommended textbook to bibliography \\cite{ComplexityAndCriticality}.\n\nThis lab explores the dynamics of the ising model; a simple model magnet \n\n\n19/01/2026\nBriefly discussed lab w/Dr Turci; he noted the \"percolation\" chapter in \\cite{ComplexityAndCriticality} as a good starting point since it introduces many ideas relating to phase transitions that will be useful for this project\n\n\nBlackboard resources \\cite{labMaterials} \"ising1.pdf\" have provided a general overview of background concepts and information. Useful ideas and concepts summarised in \"0.5 background theory and concepts.\" These are NOT the full background theory for this lab, but represent a useful starting point.\n\n\n21/01/2026\nCalled lab partner to introduce self; went over basic logistics and plans, are now on same page.\n\nBb materials \"earmark\" list:\n\n* \"ising1.pdf\", \"ising2.pdf\" - recaps basic stat mech theory, and covers basic setup of ising model\n* \"ising exercise.ppt\" - notes metropolis algorithm, alongside some observables to compute\n* \"finite-size-effects.pdf\" - goes over phase transition details - order parameters and critical exponents - \n\n\nLooking through more of the BB materials; and trying to think of vague plan:\n\n* Go through BB \"finite size effects.pdf\"\n* Go through \"percolation\" chapter \\cite{ComplexityAndCriticality} - (in retrospect this may take a while) - note section 1.8 supposedly outlines extraction of critical exponents \n* Familiarize self w/python simulation provided\n* Refactor code in a .py file - jupyter notebooks are more annoying to work with in my experience\n\t* Additional benefit: lets me use my personal library \\cite{nayanUtils} which may be useful\n* Refactor/expand code \"architecture\" generally - some potential ideas:\n\t* MAYBE rework simulation to allow arbitrary dimensionality (I.E, 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D…) - suspect there may be interesting comparisons for different dimensionalities\n\t* Rework as object orriented - each config could be it's own object with observable methods (I.E, computeEnergy, magnetisation…) and simulation step method - a \"simulation run\" class could then act as a wrapper for many config objects over time\n\t\t* May also need to handle different simulations \"in parallel\" - I.E, need to vary sim parameter to generate data points\n\t\t* Maybe set it up s.t configuration is object w/update method; overwrites itself; is a data destructive idea, however should only need a final \"equilibrium\" configuration for a given set of sim parameters\n\t\t\t* Then a \"dataset\" object would be a list of final configs + some metadata (I.E, lattice size, # sim steps, dimensionality…)\n\t* Export/import method - given the computational nature of this lab, heavy compute runs may occur - being able to save raw simulation runs data in a standard format may save compute time\n\t* Additional observable computation - current code computes energy and magnetisation - adding additional observables may be useful for investigation, I.E:\n\t\t* Heat capacity\n\t\t* Susceptibility\n\t\t* Helmholtz free energy\n* Maybe setup shared github repo w/lab partner\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"0_4_General_pre_prep_log.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
